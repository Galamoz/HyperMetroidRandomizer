###### Important technique to know for Hyper Metroid randomizers: Angle Down (L by default) + Down while midair to instant morphball.

#### Rules:

      Unlock the 15 Gates to access Tourian and defeat Mother Brain
      Level design modified to prevent morph locks and increase item variety
      Walljumping is required
      Tourian Item may only be obtained before Baby Metroid trigger
     
      
#### Casual Difficulty

      All 100 Items are included
      Varia Suit does not spawn in Norfair / Lower Norfair
      Gravity Suit does not spawn in Maridia / Maridia Depths / Wrecked Ship (past Phantoon)
      Morphing Ball may only spawn in Crateria
      Better distribution on Energy Tanks to assist casual play
      Infinite Bomb Jump is not required (more frequent early space jump spawns)

#### Veteran Difficulty

      All 100 Items are included
      Experimental Difficulty:
            Gravity Suit may spawn wherever possible
            Varia Suit may not spawn in Lower Nofair
            Certain item combinations for hellruns / gravity suit hellruns may not be possible.
            Certain deep suitless underwater sections may not be possible without High Jump Boots and Springball.
            Morphing Ball may spawn in both Norfair and Crateria.
      Different algorithm for increased randomization
      Decreased frequency of Energy Tanks
      IBJ, midair springball jump, and other advanced techniques are required
